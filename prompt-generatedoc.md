## GitHub Copilot Agent Prompt: Aspire Solution Analysis & Documentation

1. **Launch the current solution** (a .NET Aspire Host).
   - If the application requires a token, ask the user to perform the login before proceeding.

2. **Analyze the entire solution** (all projects, code, and configuration files in the `src` folder) to understand the overall goal and architecture.
3. **Analyze the AspireApp2.AppHost project** to generate an architecture diagram representing the solution's structure and service relationships.
4. **Create a detailed Markdown file. The file name must end with the current date and time in the following format: `SolutionOverview-yyyyMMdd-hhmmss.md`**
   - Where:
     - `yyyy` is the 4-digit year
     - `MM` is the 2-digit month
     - `dd` is the 2-digit day
     - `hh` is the 2-digit hour (24-hour format)
     - `mm` is the 2-digit minute
     - `ss` is the 2-digit second
   - For example: `SolutionOverview-20250711-123022.md`
   - Explains the goal and purpose of the solution.
   - Describes the architecture, main components, and their interactions.
   - **Includes the generated architecture diagram as a separate section in the documentation file. The architecture diagram must be in ASCII format, for example:**

```

   - Provides as much detail as possible about the solution’s design, features, and intended use.
   - **The generated documentation must be saved in a `docs` folder at the root of the repository. If the `docs` folder does not exist, it must be created.**
5. **(Optional, only if user confirms)**: Use Playwright MCP server tools to:
   - Capture a screenshot of the Aspire dashboard.
   - Capture a screenshot of the main frontend page.
   - If Playwright MCP server tools can't launch the app, ask the user for the correct Aspire launch URL. By default, use: https://localhost:17187
   - **All screenshots must be saved in the `docs/screenshots` folder. If the `docs/screenshots` folder does not exist, it must be created.**

**Instructions:**
- Ensure the markdown is well-structured, with sections for Overview, Architecture, Components, and Screenshots.
- Use the screenshots to visually illustrate the dashboard and frontend.
- Be thorough in your analysis and explanations.
