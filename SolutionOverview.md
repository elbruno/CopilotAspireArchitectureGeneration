# SolutionOverview.md

## Overview

This solution is a distributed .NET Aspire application targeting .NET 9, orchestrating multiple services including a Blazor-based web frontend, an API service, and a Redis cache. It leverages Aspire's capabilities for service discovery, health checks, resilience, and distributed application management.

## Architecture

The solution consists of the following main components:

- **Aspire AppHost**: The entry point and orchestrator for the distributed application. It defines and manages the lifecycle of all services, including dependencies and startup order.
- **API Service**: A minimal API providing weather forecast data. It exposes endpoints for the frontend and is discoverable via Aspire's service discovery.
- **Web Frontend (Blazor)**: An interactive Blazor Server application that consumes the API service and provides a user interface. It uses service discovery to communicate with the API and leverages Redis for output caching.
- **Redis Cache**: Used for output caching to improve performance and scalability.
- **ServiceDefaults**: A shared library that encapsulates common Aspire patterns such as health checks, OpenTelemetry tracing, and service discovery configuration.

- **ServiceDefaults**: A shared library that encapsulates common Aspire patterns such as health checks, OpenTelemetry tracing, and service discovery configuration.

### Component Interactions

- The **Web Frontend** communicates with the **API Service** using HTTP, with service discovery and resilience features enabled by Aspire.
- Both the **Web Frontend** and **API Service** use the **ServiceDefaults** library for consistent configuration.
- The **Web Frontend** uses the **Redis Cache** for output caching.
- The **AppHost** ensures all services are started in the correct order and are healthy before marking the application as ready.

## Components

### AspireApp2.AppHost
- Orchestrates the distributed application.
- Defines resources: Redis (cache), API Service, Web Frontend.
- Ensures dependencies are started and healthy.


- Blazor Server app with interactive components.
- Fetches weather data from the API Service using a typed HTTP client.
- Uses Redis for output caching.
- Implements service discovery and resilience.

### AspireApp2.ServiceDefaults
- Provides extension methods for health checks, OpenTelemetry, and service discovery.
- Used by both API and Web projects for consistent configuration.

### AspireApp2.Tests
- Contains integration tests for the distributed application.
- Verifies that the web frontend is available and returns expected responses.

## Features & Intended Use

- **Distributed orchestration**: Easily manage and monitor multiple services with Aspire.
- **Resilience and health**: Built-in health checks, telemetry, and service discovery for robust distributed systems.
- **Performance**: Output caching with Redis and efficient service-to-service communication.
- **Extensibility**: Shared ServiceDefaults library for consistent configuration across services.
