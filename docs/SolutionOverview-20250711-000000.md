# Solution Overview

## Overview

This solution, **CopilotAspireArchitectureGeneration**, is a .NET Aspire-based distributed application designed to demonstrate how to generate architecture diagrams and documentation from an Aspire solution using prompt-driven approaches. The solution leverages modern .NET Aspire features for service orchestration, health checks, distributed tracing, and resilience.

## Goal and Purpose

The primary goal of this solution is to provide a reference implementation for:
- Building distributed applications using .NET Aspire.
- Demonstrating service orchestration, health checks, and observability.
- Showcasing how to document and visualize the architecture of Aspire-based solutions.

## Architecture

The solution is composed of several projects and services, orchestrated by the Aspire AppHost. The main components are:

- **AspireApp2.AppHost**: The entry point and orchestrator for the distributed application. It defines and manages the lifecycle of all services, including databases, cache, API, and frontend.
- **AspireApp2.ApiService**: A minimal Web API providing weather forecast data. It connects to a SQL Server database for data persistence.
- **AspireApp2.Web**: A Blazor-based frontend application that consumes the API and uses Redis for output caching.
- **AspireApp2.ServiceDefaults**: A shared library that provides common service defaults, such as health checks, service discovery, and OpenTelemetry instrumentation.
- **Redis Cache**: Used for caching and improving performance of the frontend.
- **SQL Server (productsDb)**: Provides persistent storage for the API service.

### Component Interactions

- The **AppHost** orchestrates the startup and dependencies of all services.
- The **Web frontend** communicates with the **API service** to fetch weather data and uses **Redis** for caching.
- The **API service** interacts with the **SQL Server** database for data storage.

## Main Components

### AspireApp2.AppHost
- Orchestrates all services and manages dependencies.
- Configures SQL Server, Redis, API, and Web frontend projects.
- Ensures correct startup order using `.WaitFor()` and `.WithReference()`.

### AspireApp2.ApiService
- Minimal Web API exposing a `/weatherforecast` endpoint.
- Uses service defaults for health checks and observability.
- Connects to the SQL Server database for data persistence.

### AspireApp2.Web
- Blazor Server frontend.
- Uses `WeatherApiClient` to call the API service.
- Integrates Redis output caching for performance.

### AspireApp2.ServiceDefaults
- Provides shared configuration for health checks, service discovery, and OpenTelemetry.
- Ensures consistent observability and resilience across all services.

### Redis Cache
- Used by the frontend for output caching.

### SQL Server (productsDb)
- Persistent storage for the API service.

## Features
- Distributed application orchestration with .NET Aspire.
- Health checks and readiness/liveness endpoints.
- OpenTelemetry-based distributed tracing and metrics.
- Service discovery and resilience patterns.
- Output caching with Redis.
- Minimal API and Blazor frontend.

## Intended Use
This solution is intended as a reference for developers building distributed .NET Aspire applications, and for those looking to automate architecture documentation and visualization.
